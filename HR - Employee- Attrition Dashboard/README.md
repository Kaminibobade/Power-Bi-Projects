# Situation:
The project aimed to evaluate factors related to employee attrition, such as distance from home to office, job role impact, and other variables.

# Task:
## The specific tasks involved in the project were as follows:

Analyze the data on 1470 employees in the company.
Identify patterns in attrition based on employee's years of experience.
Investigate the correlation between attrition and distance to work.
Understand the reasons behind attrition, including job satisfaction levels.
Examine attrition rates based on job levels and departments.
Compare attrition between male and female employees.
Analyze attrition rates based on different job roles and age groups.

# Action:
To achieve these tasks, data analysis techniques were used to explore the dataset and extract relevant information. 
SQL queries and statistical analysis were employed to identify patterns and correlations between attrition and various factors.

# Result:
## The findings from the analysis were as follows:

The highest attrition occurred among employees with 0-10 years of experience (182 employees), while those with 31+ years of experience had very low attrition (5 employees).
A significant portion of attrition (61%) was attributed to employees leaving due to distance to work.
Job dissatisfaction was a notable reason for attrition, with 73 employees leaving for this reason, even though 46 were satisfied but still left the company.
Most attrition occurred at Level 1 job positions, with 143 employees leaving.
The R&D department had the highest attrition rate, while HR had the lowest.
Male employees had a higher attrition rate compared to females, with 150 male employees leaving.
Specific job roles also impacted attrition, with Laboratory Technicians having the highest attrition (62), followed by Sales Executives.
Employees below the age of 35, including freshers, had the highest attrition, while those above 56 years of age tended to stay longer in the organization.
Recommendations:
Based on the results, the following recommendations were proposed:

Develop a comprehensive employee retention strategy to address the identified attrition factors.
Focus on providing support and engagement initiatives for employees with 0-10 years of experience.
Address commute and work-life balance concerns to reduce attrition related to distance to work.
Improve job satisfaction by implementing feedback mechanisms and recognizing employee contributions.
Provide targeted development opportunities and career growth paths for employees at Level 1.
Analyze and address the high attrition rate in the R&D department.
Implement gender-specific retention initiatives and tailor retention efforts based on job role-specific needs.
Offer retention measures catering to the different age groups within the organization.
